Just a newbie creating a noob project to learn and improve Java coding.

Honestly, I just followed a template online and worked off from there. Still only know how to start from here so am using this as a start to learn how to write from scratch. 

New to this platform and everything about coding. 

Please do comment on what best practices can be followed and what I can improve on. Bash it up as much as you like. Much appreciated.
